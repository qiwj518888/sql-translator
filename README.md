# SQL Translator (SQL to Natural Language and Natural Language to SQL)

Welcome to the SQL and Natural Language Translator! This tool is designed to make it easy for anyone to translate SQL (Structured Query Language) commands into natural language and vice versa. SQL is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases, and while it's a powerful tool, it can also be quite complex and difficult to understand. On the other hand, natural language is the language that we speak and write in everyday life, and it's often the preferred way to communicate for people who are not familiar with technical jargon.

With the SQL and Natural Language Translator, you don't need to be a SQL expert to understand what's going on in your database, or to write SQL queries. You can simply type in your query in natural language and get the corresponding SQL code, or type in your SQL code and get a human-readable translation.This project is 100% free and open source.

### If you want to contribute, looking to implement this design in the upcoming weeks, if you have spare time, help is appreciated.
